# Not The End - Remote Play Suite

This project contains two Python applications for playing the "Not The End" TTRPG remotely.

-   **Player Application (`player_app/`):** Allows players to create, manage, and save their Hero sheets.
-   **Narrator Application (`narrator_app/`):** Acts as a server for players to connect to, allowing the Narrator to view Hero sheets and manage game Tests.

## Core Mechanics

[cite_start]The game uses the HEXSYS system, which involves drawing tokens from a bag to resolve tests, rather than rolling dice.

## Setup
